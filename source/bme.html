                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the starting of the college we have Medical Electronics 
                    branch and from 2015 onwards branch renamed as Biomedical Engg. With modification in syllabus. 
                    In this diploma course students will get a strong base in electronics. They have to study Basic Electronics, 
                    Electrical Engg., Electronic circuits, Linear integrated circuits, Digital Electronics, 
                    Communication Engg.etc.After that syllabus includes varios imaging technologies,Therapeutic 
                    equipments, diagnostic equips, analytical equipments and basics of hardware and networking. 
                    Candidates completed this course can work as biomedical engineers /service technicians 
                    in hospitals or biomedical equipment agencies. Many of the Biomedical  alumni are working 
                    in organizations manufacturing of biomedical equipments.Like all other diploma courses, 
                    short term and long term courses are available for biomedical diploma holders. 
                    Biomedical engineering focuses on the advances that improve human health and health 
                    care at all levels.
