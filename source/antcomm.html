				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspRagging’ means the doing of any act which causes, 
				or is likely to cause any physical, psychological or physiological harm of 
				apprehension or shame or embarrassment to a student, and includes:
				<br><br>
    				(a) Teasing or abusing of playing Practical joke on, or causing hurt to any student.
    				<br><br>
				(b) Asking any student to do any act, or perform anything, which he/she would not, 
				in the ordinary course, be willing to do or perform.
				<br><br>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspRagging is different from other crimes because the motive 
				is solely to get perverse pleasure. Ragging is also different from other crimes as it is 
				actively promoted by certain sections of the society.
				<br><br>
                    		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Ragging is a  disturbing reality in the higher 
				education system of our country. Despite the fact that over  the years ragging 
				has claimed hundreds of innocent lives and has ruined careers of  thousands of 
				bright   students,  the  practice  is  still  perceived by  many as  a  way of 
				‘familiarization’ and an ‘initiation into 
                    		the real world’ for  young  college-going students. Other organisations/bodies 
                    		working in this  field have also  attempted  to define ragging, the variety of 
                    		definitions being reflective of differences in perspective.
