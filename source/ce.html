                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A diploma in computer engineering or computer science engineering is a 10+3 level of academic programme. 
                    It provides students with the basic knowledge of computer science, mathematics and computing techniques and engineering concepts. 
                    Students enrolled in the course acquire skills that help them to become an IT professional and enter the world of work. 
                    The duration of the course is three years. The course is composed of core concepts in computer science, such as operating systems, 
                    databases, and mobile computing. It also includes communication skills. Its curriculum is designed to prepare students for 
                    various job roles. Students can opt to pursue their careers as software developers or go on to pursue higher education. 
                    A diploma in computer engineering will equip you with the skills to program in a particular language and make you employable in the field. The diploma you earn may be in Java, Android, or web programming, which you can specialize in. 
                    The coursework for a diploma in computer engineering will cover a variety of software and hardware topics. You will learn 
                    how to code in Java and C++, as well as the theory of programming languages. You'll also learn how to evaluate algorithms 
                    and design computer-based systems.
